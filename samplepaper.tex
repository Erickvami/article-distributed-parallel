    Having the knowledge that both of them are population-based algorithms it can be
    defined that a migration between 2 or more populations are possible, and this kind
    hybrid can be helpful to increase the possibility to find the optimal result (the best
    of the best), there is where fits the concept of Multi-population.
    For this kind of work we used asynchronous functions, serverless functions,
multithread and a distributed architecture taking advantage for functional
programming and serverless architecture.
Even nature works like that... parallel, asynchronous and distributed.

\section{Introduction}
A universe of solutions can exist for a single problem and sometimes is too big and complex 
to solve them in a traditional way. That is why heuristic and population based algorithms are required. This kind
of algorithms are very useful to solve combinatories problems, however, usually one is better than others 
to solve one thing and another is great to solve another problem, and there are several cases 
stucked in optimal local values.

Here we propose an architecture composed by serverless functions to create a multi-populations that
will process sub-populations in distributed function architecture and they are going to be parallel and asynchronous
making each sub-population distributed and independent. And comunicating using migrations to help each other 
preventing fall into optimal local values.

The distributed architectures are having extensive use in the software
industry because of their high performance, many systems are being
created and migrating step by step to microservices and... in a nearly
future... the new architectures called serverless, which proposes the
use of “Function as a Service” (FaaS).


\subsection{Serverless}
Recently, the cloud providers as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, etc. Offers a new alternative to programming throught interfaces called Serverless Computing,
this kind of platform consist in a very simple mecanism where the developer upload the code into the platform and 
execute it as mamy times it is required scalling and allowing do this in a parallel way. This way the developers do not worry about servers, connections and other configurations.
In serverless it pays only for what is used. Even there are some platform that allows to install them into your own server to do your own local architecture serverless.

\begin{figure}[htp]

  \end{figure}

\subsubsection{Serverless Function} 
In math a function is a relation between a set of inputs and an allowed set of outputs with
the idea that each input goes to a single output. But in computer science is small bits of code 
that do only one thing and are easily to understand
and support. In serverless this functions could be triggered by an event that would be menssages, http request,etc.
Also is known that each function scales independently and is stateless with a short duration.


\section{Proposed architecture}

The propose is an architecture that allows to process a simple population that is divided into sub-populations
distributing them to process in different ways and then communicating each other with purpose of increase the possibility
to find the best fitness of a function. This architecture can accept the use of an indeterminate number of algorithms, allowing
an easy hybridation and continuous adaptability for different problems.

This architecture consist in 3 nodes, they are explained on the next points:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Manager: Here the multi-population is managed, it is initialized how to process it, 
  followed by the subpopulations, which when they are concepted trigger an event that sends 
  the subpopulations to be stored in a file JSON of MongoDB (preventing to saturate the memory) 
  and to a message queue that is directed to its subsequent processing in the “Receiver” section 
  that is our cluster of functions (Faas), because each subpopulation requires the execution of a 
  different algorithm, there is a different channel in the web sockets for each type of algorithm 
  that triggers its respective serverless function.
  Once a subpopulation is processed, it is returned and a selection is made for the sub-population 
  migration. The migration selection is made by taking the population attribute of the subpopulation 
  that was returned and the subpopulation that it have been selected among the best 2, it should be 
  noted that the decision to identify the best from the 2 is made randomly. Once the selection is made, 
  a Splitting Point Uniform crossing will be made.
  The 2 new subpopulations replace their self and are resent it back to their respective
serverless function and this process is repeited until completing the number of assigned migrations
for the multi-population. Of course this whole process is performed asynchronously avoiding wait for all responses from serverless functions to perform a crossover or a
update of the multi-population status \cite{Lovbjerg2001,Jimeno2019}. In the following figure you can see from
illustrative way how the multi-population is composed.
\begin{figure}[htp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{multipopulation.png}
  \caption{Multipopulation representation.} \label{fig1}
  \end{figure}
\item Message Provider: Its purpose is the creation of a sub-population messages queue which is the 
comunication channel between the sub-population Manager and the Receiver (FaaS), each message is a 
trigger for the execution of a GA or PSO function. Thanks to the message queue, it is possible to perform 
the serverless functions asynchronously, avoiding that the algorithm wait for responses independently of 
their duration and the simultaneous evaluation of different sub-populations independent of its algorithm 
or characteristics.
\item Receiver: The following section contains the Serverless functions of the algorithms to be executed, 
reduced the best possible using the functional programming paradigm so that they can be converted into FaaS 
without problems, in addition to achieving a completely clean and fast execution \cite{Roberts2016} . Each message received 
on this node is executed in the form of a multi-threaded process in parallel, this allows to having more than 
one population-based search algorithm running at the same time, and making a copy of itself each algorithm 
function as required.
\end{itemize}


To develop this architecture the applied technologies are based in JavaScript using Node JS as it can be
see it in the General Architecture Flowchart.

  \caption{General Architecture Flowchart.} \label{fig1}
  \end{figure}

\subsection{Sub-population definition}

Individuals are created composed of 2 types of information, the one that is active or useful for crossing
and the one that is not. The population contains the series of possible solutions, while the rest contains 
the information on how the processing for the search of the optimal solutions will be executed, linked directly 
with their respective algorithms.

  \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{subpopulationDefinition.png}
  \caption{Sub-population composition.} \label{fig1}
  \end{figure}

\subsection{Splitting Point Uniform Migration}
A uniform mask is created to apply the migration between individuals
from 2 sub-populations. The selected data are combined using the middle point between the
selected points by the mask. This process iterates the 2 sub-populations to randomly swap values and
replace some of them with middle points.

  \caption{Splitting Point Uniform process.} \label{fig1}
  \end{figure}

  \subsection{Migration Selection}

  Using migration selection by tournament keeping up the information of the best sub-population of the multi-population.

\section{Experiments and Results}
\subsection{Experiments}
Now that an interaction between sub-populations with different algorithms it is working and  hybridation have been a success, using until now the added algorithms (GA and PSO) algorithms, all thanks to the 
developed architecture, lets procede to the experiments.
This section is going to be the execution of several experiments from 2 to 40 dimensions, with a stop criterial 
of an error below  0.5E-8, without a parameter optimization method, waiting that the architecture by its self
would be enough to increase the possibility to find a better optimal result than the traditional methods.
All this hoping that the results will probe the needness of this kind of architecture on increasing dimensions.
To test if the architecture was useful, several experiments were made to solve
benchmark functions, for this case the functions are Sphere, Rastrigin and Rosenbrock.
Using 10 sub-population for each experiment and maximum 4 migrations per sub-population with different algorithms and parameters for each sub-population.

\begin{figure}[htp]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{benchmark.png}
    \caption{Benchmark functions for experimentation.} \label{fig1}
    \end{figure}

\subsection{Parameters Configuration} 

This architecture modifies the traditional way to work with population based algorithms, then the experiments 
could not be parameterized as usually are.

Then the experiments are scaled by their number of evaluations and the
parameters must be configured to be adjusted to the next criterial, using the next expression:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:hesitancy-interpretation}
   Evaluations = 10^{5} Dimensions
   \end{equation}

For example, if the experiment has 2 dimensions, the maximum number of evaluations will be 200,0000, for 10 dimensions will be 1,000,000 of evaluacions and the same with the others dimensions.

\section{Conclusion}

This architecture is completely scalable and useful for hybridation of multiple algorithms,
until now is only GA and PSO but according with the results with this kind of architecture
there is no limit and it works better than multi-populations with only one algorithm, also
every experiment executes in short times because serverless functions searching in an asynchronous way getting a fast convergence.
